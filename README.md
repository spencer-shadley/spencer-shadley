### Hi, I'm Spencer ğŸ‘‹

Currently I'm a lead software engineer at Tableau. I've also founded a few startups and was recently an instructor for the University of Washington.

My experience has primarily been in full-stack web development and mobile app development but am interested in solving interesting problems regardless of the medium they take shape.

I'm passionate about growing others, myself and making a positive impact in the world through software.

âš¡ Fun fact - I like _really_ spicy food. I put carolina reaper flakes in almost everything I eat! ğŸŒ‹
